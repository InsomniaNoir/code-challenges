# Code Challenges Repository

This repository contains files of Ruby code challenges completed on various sites:
* [CodeWars.com](http://www.codewards.com)
* [HackerRank.com](http://www.hackerrank.com)

I tried include documentation from [Ruby-Docs](http://www.ruby-docs.org) and any other sources I run across.
