# Consider the following example. Let's say you have a list of 100 integers
#   and you want to group them according to their even and odd value.
#
# In Ruby, you can easily do this by using group_by method provide by Enumerabl
#  module.
#
#   > (1..5).group_by {|x| x%2}
#   {1=>[1,3,5], 0=>[2, 4]}
#
#   Of course this is a very simple example and its use can be very complicated
#   in nature.
#
# In this challenge, your task is to group the students into two categories
#   corresponding to their marks obtained in a test. The list of students will be
#   provided in a marks hash with student name as key and marks obtained (out of 100)
#   as value pair, along with the pass_marks as argument.
#
# The method group_by_marks must return a Hash containing an array of students
#   who passed as value to Passed key, and those who failed as value to Failed key.
#   If a particular key is empty, don't return that key.
#
# For example:
#   > marks = {"Ramesh":23, "Vivek":40, "Harsh":88, "Mohammad":60}
#   > group_by_marks(marks, 30)
#   => {"Failed"=>[["Ramesh", 23]], "Passed"=>[["Vivek", 40], ["Harsh", 88], ["Mohammad", 60]]}

def group_by_marks(marks, pass_marks)
  marks.group_by { |key, value| value < pass_marks ? "Failed" : "Passed" }
end

## DOCUMENTATION

# group_by â†’ an_enumerator
# Groups the collection by result of the block.
#
# Returns a hash where the keys are the evaluated result from the block
#   and the values are arrays of elements in the collection that correspond
#   to the key.
#
# If no block is given an enumerator is returned.
#
# (1..6).group_by { |i| i%3 }   #=> {0=>[3, 6], 1=>[1, 4], 2=>[2, 5]}
